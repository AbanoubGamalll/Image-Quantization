# Image Quantization

> ### The idea of color quantization is to reduce the number of colors in a full-resolution digital color image to a smaller set of representative colors called a color palette.

> ### The project takes an image & K-clustering (Number of colors) from the user and outputs the new image.

> ### Using a fast algorithm and making a good choice in color to cluster it by it to make an image good you canâ€™t make a difference between them if K-clustering is not large.
